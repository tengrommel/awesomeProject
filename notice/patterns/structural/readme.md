# Structural Patterns

> Structural patterns,as the name implies,help us to shape our applications with commonly used structures and relationships

The Go language,by nature,encourages use of composition almost exlusively by its lack of inheritance.

## Composite design pattern

The Composite design pattern favors composition(commonly defined as a has a relationship) over inheritance(an is a relationship).

## Adapter design pattern

- Using an incompatible interface with an Adapter object

## Bridge design pattern

> It decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

This cryptic explanation just means that you could even decouple the most basic form of functionality:

## Proxy design pattern

> The Proxy pattern usually wraps an object to hide some of its characteristics.

## Decorator design pattern

> A different field where the Decorator is very powerful may not be so obvious though it reveal itself
when creating types with lots of features based on user inputs,preferences,or similar inputs.

## Facade design pattern

> Imagine that we group many proxies in a single point such as a file or a library.
